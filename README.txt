ARG_Test is a website meant to teach about ARG's and infrom the viewers ofthe various ways to not only play them but also enjoy them.
Using a simple website cleverly disguised to give the code word "Attua" I hope to make a place where it is not only visible to them but readily accessible to the library staff's.
