      <h1>How do you find ARG's</h1>
      <p>Simply put you don't. Most ARGS are found by pure dumb luck and popularity revolves completly around how it spreads. Some ARG's may never even see the light of day, others will fizzle out only to become popluar years later.</p>
      <h1>How will they find ours?</h1>
      <p>Using the method sometimes called "medium" we arg going to spread infromation of it through word of mouth. Why is this called medium? medium refers to the intial pusher of an ARG refering specifally to a group who are making or hosting pasrts of the ARG, and now use this knowledge to invite others. Aside from Medium you also have thrid party, straight, and float. Thrid party is simply using someone not affilated to the ARG to increase your poplarity such as youtubers or socail media influncers. Straight is just the Puppet master inviting other to join. Float is the more comon and better made ARG starter. how ever it relies heavily on luck and "prayer" so while many succeful ARG's use this many more simply drift off and are rare if ever seen.</p>
