      <h1>About Our ARG</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>The story for this ARG is going to be quite simple. Alice has once again fallen down the rabbit hole leading to her disappearance from Crestview Library's book.<br> 
          <img src="./Alice.jpg" alt="Alice book" id="alice"><br>
          This leads to our “Alice” appearing in the real world and starts her on a journey through Crestview.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>In this we will be using a series of tools from simple Facebook and Instagram accounts to the much more time intesive Websites and Real world decorations. Becuase our tools are so wildly differnt we will be including</p>

        <h3>How the libraries fit in</h3>
        <p>As This ARG is desgined mainly as a test and proof of concept it is limited to just Crestview Public library. However with success we plan to expand it to the entire co-op, what will be needed with that is a firm line of communication which can be done through me at: rcluff@readokaloosa.org</p>
