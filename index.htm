    <h2> What is an ARG?</h2>
    <p>An ARG at is core is a story based game where something not of this world (people, worlds, animals, magic, or anything else) leaks into our world via the internet. We will get more into this when we talk about types of ARGs but suffice it to say there are a variety of ways they can take place the main thing to remember however is that in some way it connects to our world. Be it a prop, videos, or even just coordinates something has to show up in our world.</p>
