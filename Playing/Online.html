      <h1>How To intreact with the internet in an ARG!</h1>
      <p>When playing online it is important to follow some basic rules. Which can be condesned to the saying "Reasearch research research."</p>
      <div>
        <h1>Have you ever wanted to feel like a hacker?</h1>
        <p>Press f12 or control+U to read the rest of this. Following the body and clicking on every div until you see one with"class="hide"" this will show you the entire site.</p>
        <div class="hide">
          <p>Get this! By playing online you can learn about not only codes but how the world of technology works. The fact you can read this mean you have just learned about a fundamental of websites. The source codes. Here We can hide information or even hidden links that you won’t see. While not every website will use this method the Cheshire cat will be hiding fun wild clues in the code. Including hidden images and forgotten tools.</p>

          <p>Lets try an exercise. Press f12 on the website and open the div named hide. On the bottom you should see a line that looks like this:
            .hide{
            Display; none;
          </p>
          <p>Click none and change the value to nothing or “show”  sit back and watch the site change.</p>
