      <h1>IRL or In Real Life</h1>
      <p>When it comes to ARG's there is one fundamental connection that they all have. In some way, shape, or form the ARG will involve the real world. Some do this by referring to current events or bringing websites or companies to our world.</p>
      <p>For this ARG we will be using Crestview as our launching point, forcing players to go through a rabbit hole or find clues they can see in real life. Using tools mentioned during the presentation as well as other players will find their way through the story.</p>
